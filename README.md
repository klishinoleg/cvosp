Minimalistic CV Website using FastAPI & React

# Description:

A personal resume website built with a modern full-stack approach using FastAPI for the backend and React for the
frontend. The site presents structured CV information such as experience, education, skills, and projects, all fetched
via a REST API. The backend is lightweight and fast, powered by asynchronous endpoints and Python. The frontend offers a
clean, responsive interface with dynamic components for easy updates and interaction. This setup allows for full
separation of concerns and easy deployment, making it ideal for developers who want to showcase their profile with both
elegance and technical efficiency.
